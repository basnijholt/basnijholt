- 👷🏻‍♂️ Currently at IonQ, doing my bit in building a quantum computer.
- 🌟 A deep dive into computational quantum mechanics earned me my PhD.
- 🎨 I've crafted a few libraries for Home Assistant, making home automation a bit more fun.
- ⚒️ Always tinkering with tools to speed up numerical simulations.
- 🏅 Big on software quality, user experience, and smooth performance.
- 🐍 Python is my go-to language in most of my projects.
- Some of my favorite creations:
  - 📈 **[python-adaptive/adaptive](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive/)**: Parallel active learning of mathematical functions? Check!
  - 🧬 **[unidep](https://github.com/basnijholt/unidep/)**: Unifying pip and conda requirements, because who likes confusion?
  - 💡 **[adaptive-lighting](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting/)**: A custom component for Home Assistant to keep your lighting just right.
  - 📝 **[markdown-code-runner](https://github.com/basnijholt/markdown-code-runner/)**: Run code blocks right within your Markdown files – yes, it's as cool as it sounds!
  - 🕒 **[rsync-time-machine.py](https://github.com/basnijholt/rsync-time-machine.py/)**: Time Machine-style backups with rsync for the minimalists.
  - 🏠 **[home-assistant-config](https://github.com/basnijholt/home-assistant-config/)**: Over 100 documented automations in my Home Assistant config, because automation is the future (and it's pretty neat!).
