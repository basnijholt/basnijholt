- 👷🏻‍♂️ Currently at [IonQ](https://ionq.com/), doing my bit in building a quantum computer, before that I was at [Microsoft Quantum](https://quantum.microsoft.com/).
- 🌟 A deep dive into computational topological quantum mechanics earned me [my PhD](https://github.com/basnijholt/thesis).
- 🎨 I've crafted [a](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting) [few](https://github.com/basnijholt/aiokef) [libraries](https://github.com/basnijholt/miflora) for Home Assistant, making home automation a bit more fun.
- ⚒️ Made other tools [speed up](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive) and [massively parallelize](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-scheduler) numerical simulations.
- 🏅 Very passionate about open-source, software quality, user experience, and smooth performance.
- 🐍 Python is my go-to language in most of my projects.
- Some of my favorite creations:
  - 📈 **[python-adaptive/adaptive](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive/)**: Parallel active learning of mathematical functions? Check!
  - 🧬 **[unidep](https://github.com/basnijholt/unidep/)**: Unifying pip and conda requirements, single command to set up a full dev environment.
  - 💡 **[adaptive-lighting](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting/)**: A custom component for Home Assistant to keep your lighting in synn with the sun.
  - 📝 **[markdown-code-runner](https://github.com/basnijholt/markdown-code-runner/)**: Run (hidden) code blocks right within your Markdown files - keep simple `README.md`s in sync!
  - 🕒 **[rsync-time-machine.py](https://github.com/basnijholt/rsync-time-machine.py/)**: Time Machine-style backups with rsync for the minimalists.
  - 🏠 **[home-assistant-config](https://github.com/basnijholt/home-assistant-config/)**: Over 100 documented automations in my Home Assistant config
